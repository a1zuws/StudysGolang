- Module Creation :
``` E:\StudysGolang> go mod init <module name> ```

- Create A Folder : 
``` E:\> mkdir goWorks --> E:\> cd goWorks ```

- Terminal Output: 
``` E:\StudysGolang> go run main.go ```

- Install JSON Server:
``` E:\StudysGolang> npm install -g json-server```
  - *ATTENTION! =>* If you get an error in JSON Server installation, install it from ```nodejs.org``` site, close and reopen your workspace.

- Running The JSON Server:
```E:\StudysGolang> json-server --watch db.json```
  - If it fails after running it, type `npx` followed by a space and then `json-server --watch db.json` and run it again.
  - So like this : `E:\StudysGolang> npx json-server --watch db.json`
